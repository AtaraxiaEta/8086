8086
====

These are some lab exercises on Microcontrollers (clumsy educational devices based on 8086 architecture), which were originally taught in ccst of JLU 2009. I caught them in the corner when cleansing one of my old blogs. I still want to put them apart not because they would be still useful, but as a memoir of my primary exercises on Assembly language. My very first one shall be some BASIC commands which were able to move some predefined image patterns to move horizontally or diagonally. I still remember the joy they brought to me (I was about 11 years old).
